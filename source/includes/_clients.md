Clients
=======
There are several clients made to interface with a GAKU Engine server. All samples other than the 
shell examples and JSON example data are using either the Manabu Ruby client, libmanabu, or a 
libmanabu based native interface.
  
All examples in this documentation assume you have the required gems/libraries/packages installed 
or are accessible.

```shell
```

```json
```

```ruby
require 'manabu'
```

```cpp
#include "manabu.h" 
```
